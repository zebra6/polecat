   Given the following 3 by 3 grid where the (first row, first column) is
   represented by (0,0):

   0,1 1,2 3,3
   1,1 3,3 3,2
   3,0 1,3 null

   we need to find if we can get to each cell in the table by following the cell
   locations at the current cell we are at. We can only start at cell (0,0) and
   follow the cell locations from that cell, to the cell it indicates and keep on
   doing the same for every cell.
